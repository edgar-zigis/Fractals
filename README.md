# Fractals
A list of popular fractals implemented in my university times.

### Burning Ship
```
The Burning Ship fractal is a type of fractal that is similar in concept to the Mandelbrot set
but has a distinctive, flame-like appearance. It was discovered by
Michael Michelitsch and Otto E. Rössler in 1992.

### Celticbrot
```
The Celticbrot is a variation of the Mandelbrot fractal that produces patterns with knot-like,
symmetric structures—often resembling Celtic art, hence the name.

### Crystal
```
The Crystal fractal is an informal name given to a class of visually striking fractals known f
or their sharp, radial, and symmetric structures that resemble snowflakes or crystalline formations.

### Fern
```
The Fern fractal, also known as the Barnsley Fern, is a well-known example of a fractal generated
using an Iterated Function System (IFS). It beautifully models the natural appearance of a fern
leaf through a series of affine transformations.

### IFS Tree
```
An IFS Tree is a fractal generated using an Iterated Function System (IFS), a set of affine
transformations applied recursively to produce a self-similar, branching structure that resembles
a natural tree. It is conceptually similar to the Barnsley Fern but designed to model the
growth and geometry of tree branches.

### Julia
```
The Julia fractal, or Julia set, is one of the most famous and mathematically rich types of fractals,
closely related to the Mandelbrot set but with its own distinct visual and mathematical properties.

### Koch Snowflake
```
The Koch Snowflake is one of the earliest and most famous fractals, introduced by Swedish mathematician
Helge von Koch in 1904. It is known for its simple construction and counterintuitive geometric properties.

### Mandelbrot
```
The Mandelbrot set is one of the most iconic and deeply studied fractals in mathematics. Named after
mathematician Benoît B. Mandelbrot, it serves as a central object in complex dynamics and fractal geometry.

### Pentabrot
```
The Pentabrot is a higher-order generalization of the Mandelbrot set, part of a family called Multibrot sets.
It showcases the same core idea—iterating a complex function and testing for divergence—but uses a different
exponent to create unique fractal shapes.
```

### Tribrot
```
The Tribrot is the degree-3 Multibrot set, a variation of the Mandelbrot set that uses a cubic iteration instead
of a quadratic one. It's a visually striking fractal with unique rotational symmetry.
